# resource-tracker

This is a [cherry](https://github.com/squint-cljs/cherry) port of
[tech.resource](https://github.com/techascent/tech.resource), to provide
parallel functionality in an ES module.


## Usage

This is still highly experimental and minimally functional, and does not
represent a complete port. All content is still variable and will likely change
as this is tested through other projects under development.

## License

Distributed under the Eclipse Public License either version 1.0 or (at your
option) any later version.
